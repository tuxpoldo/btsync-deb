[color=#4b0082][b]BTSYNC PACKAGES FOR DEBIAN, UBUNTU AND OTHER DERIVED DISTRIBUTIONS[/b][/color]

BitTorrent® Inc. delivers for Linux users only a raw binary file without any deployment concept or setup system. It's up to the user to create a reliable startup and shutdown logic, manage configuration files, internal storage directories and everything else related to file and directory permissions, application update and various other aspects.

The BitTorrent Sync Server Package ([font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]btsync[/b][/font]) is the ideal solution for all users that want to deploy BitTorrent Sync on Linux servers running Debian or other derived distributions like Ubuntu, Raspbian, Linux Mint or similar.

[color=#ff0000][b]THIS SERVER PACKAGE IS UNOFFICIAL AND NOT THE WORK OF BITTORRENT® INC. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE BITTORRENT® INC. SUPPORT WITH QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE USE OF THE PACKAGE. YOU WILL FIND COMPETENT HELP AND SUPPORT IN THIS THREAD[/b][/color]


[color=#a52a2a][b]TYPICAL USE CASES[/b][/color]

The BitTorrent Sync Server Package is designed to run one or more BitTorrent Sync background processes (called "[i]instances[/i]") on servers where no specific user is usually logged on. Since the server package does not provide any GUI (except for the optional Web UI provided by BitTorrent Sync itself), it can be also installed on headless servers (without any desktop environment).

The server version is particularly suitable for the following use cases:
[LIST]
[*]BitTorrent Sync is used as a background service, to keep directories in sync between all servers of a distributed infrastructure like a PXE boot system and groups of shared configuration files.[/*]
[*]Always-on instances of BitTorrent Sync for providing an always available external copy and source of replicated data for other BitTorrent Sync clients.[/*]
[*]A content distribution network based on shared folders.[/*]
[*]Customized services built upon the functionality of BitTorrent Sync.[/*]
[/LIST]

This topic covers only the [b]server package[/b]. If you are searching for the [b]desktop user package,[/b] [url="http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/19560-debian-and-ubuntu-desktop-packages-for-bittorrent-sync/"][b]please look here[/b][/url].


[color=#008000][b]INSTALLATION ON DEBIAN, UBUNTU, LINUX MINT, RASPBIAN OR OTHER DEBIAN DERIVATES[/b][/color]

The most easy and fast way to install the repository is to paste that at a terminal prompt:
[code]
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL http://debian.yeasoft.net/add-btsync-repository.sh)"
[/code]
 
The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it asking for your permission. If you encounter any problems or prefer to do it manually, please [b][url=http://www.yeasoft.com/site/projects:btsync-deb:btsync-repo]look here[/url][/b].

Now update the package index and install [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]btsync[/b][/font] by pasting that at a terminal prompt:
[code]
`which sudo` apt-get update
`which sudo` apt-get install btsync
[/code]

After downloading the packages, the installation begins. The package manager will ask you, if you want a default instance of BitTorrent Sync to be created. If you answer [b]yes[/b], you will be guided through the installation and when finished you will have a fully operational BitTorrent Sync instance maintained by [i]debconf[/i]. The configuration can be modified and fine tuned at any time by performing the following command:
[code]
`which sudo` dpkg-reconfigure btsync
[/code]

Here you can also choose to delete the default instance by answering [b]no[/b] to the initial question.


[color=#008000][b]USAGE NOTES[/b][/color]

The BitTorrent Sync Server Package mainly consists of an init-style startup script that manages every operational aspect of running BitTorrent Sync instances.


[color=#006400][b]Instance Configuration Files[/b][/color]

All operational parameters for BitTorrent Sync instances are configured in configuration files located in the directory [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]/etc/btsync[/b][/font]. These configuration files basically are [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON][b]JSON Files[/b][/url] and follow a very strict syntax. In addition to the JSON specification, comments are also supported. The support of commented lines permits to specify additional parameters that are not directly parsed by the BitTorrent Sync executable itself but by the init-script.

The naming convention for configuration files defining BitTorrent Sync instances is:
[code]
<instance_name>.conf
[/code]
where [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]<instance_name>[/b][/font] should be a string consisting of alphanumeric characters.

The default instance maintained by [i]debconf[/i] has also a configuration file that is named [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]debconf-default.conf[/b][/font]. This name [b]shall never be used[/b] by manually created configuration files, since it may be deleted or overwritten by [i]debconf[/i]. This file [b]shall also never be edited manually[/b] since it is often rewritten and/or created/deleted by debconf. If you want to manage the default instance, you must always use the command:
[code]
`which sudo` dpkg-reconfigure btsync
[/code]
Each configuration file in [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]/etc/btsync[/b][/font] defines a separate running BitTorrent Sync [i]instance[/i] (that means: a process). When defining more than one instance on a system, there are some rules that must be considered:
[LIST]
[*]The listening ports (parameter [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]listening_port[/b][/font]) must be unique for each BitTorrent Sync instance[/*]
[*]The internal database path (parameter [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]storage_path[/b][/font]) must be unique for each BitTorrent Sync instance[/*]
[*]If the Web UI is enabled, the Web UI bind address and listening port (parameter [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]listen[/b][/font]) must be unique for each BitTorrent Sync instance[/*]
[/LIST]
The syntax and configuration parameters of a BitTorrent Sync configuration file are partially documented in the example file [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]/etc/btsync/samples/complex.conf[/b][/font] and in the [url=http://btsync.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BitTorrentSyncUserGuide.pdf]official BitTorrent Sync manual[/url] which can be also found in[font=courier new,courier,monospace][b] /usr/share/doc/btsync-common/BitTorrentSyncUserGuide.pdf.gz[/b][/font].

There are additional parameters that are parsed by the init script upon startup and affect many important aspects. These parameters are not parsed directly by BitTorrent Sync and therefore have to be placed in comment lines. In order to improve the readability of configuration files, they should be grouped together and placed at the beginning of the configuration file. The generic syntax of such parameters is:
[code]
// PARAMETER_NAME=<parameter value>
The following parameters are supported:
[/code]
[LIST]
[*][b]DAEMON_UID[/b]: A uid (user id) for specifying the user under which the BitTorrent Sync instance should run[/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_GID[/b]: A gid (group id) for specifying the group under which the BitTorrent Sync instance should run[/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_UMASK[/b]: The umask (up to 4 octal digits) for the BitTorrent Sync instance. If omitted the default umask is used.[/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_DEBUG[/b]: The debug mask (4 hex digits) for the BitTorrent Sync instance. If omitted the init script will not touch potential settings defined manually. If set to [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]0000[/b][/font], a potential settings file will be deleted. Full detail is set by specifying [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]FFFF[/b][/font]. The log file can be found in the directory specified by [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]storage_path[/b][/font] and is named [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]sync.log[/b][/font][/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_NICE[/b]: The niceness level of the BitTorrent Sync instance, which affects the process scheduling. Nicenesses range from -20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least favorable).[/*]
[*][b]DAEMON_BIND[/b]: This parameter works only in conjunction with the package [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]bind-shim[/b][/font]. Please see the specific section below covering the specific interface binding topic.
[/*]
[/LIST]
[code]
//
// DAEMON_UID=jdoe
// DAEMON_UMASK=0002
//
[/code]

This example will launch the instance running under the credentials of the user "[b]jdoe[/b]" using [b]0002[/b] as umask.

By specifying [b]DAEMON_UID[/b] and [b]DAEMON_GID[/b] it is possible to specify under which credentials the instance runs. In this case it [b]must[/b] be assured that the instance is able to read and write all files it must access:
[LIST=1]
[*]The instance must be able to read its own configuration file. Since the configuration file may contain sensitive data (the userame and password for the web interface), it is usually [b]owned by the user[/b] under which the instance runs and has the mode [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]400 (-r--------)[/b][/font] in order to limit the access to the specific user. Usually the init script takes care of adjusting the file permissions.[/*]
[*]The instance must be able to read and write in its [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]storage_path[/b][/font], since all internal control and status files (and the database of file hashes) are kept there. The ideal solution is to keep the [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]storage_path[/b][/font] somewhere in the home directory of the user under which the instance will run. Usually the init script takes care of adjusting the file permissions.[/*]
[*]Obviously the instance must be able to read and write the files and directories that will be synchronized.[/*]
[/LIST]
Some example configuration files are provided under [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]/etc/btsync/samples[/b][/font]


[color=#006400][b]Modular Configuration Files[/b][/color]

Sometimes it may be useful to generate configuration files out several separate parts. The typical use case is explained best by forum user Jero:

[quote name="Jero" post="82024" timestamp="1396943043"]
Is it possible to split the linux config file in multiple files?
 
I want to have a config file per shared folder. I currently manage 10-20 linux servers. The servers are all connected with btsync.
I have created a system that can push scripts to the servers en executed them. But when i need to change one shared folder on one server i just want to push a new file without to touch the other parameters in the config file.
[/quote]


If you want to create a modular configuration file, create a directory in [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]/etc/btsync[/b][/font] named like you would name the configuration file, but with an additional [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b].d[/b][/font] extension and put the parts of your configuration file in it. The daemon init script will generate a configuration file at every start by joining the parts [b]in alphabetical order[/b]. Parts must be text files with the extension [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b].part[/b][/font].

[color=#006400][b]Default Startup Parameters[/b][/color]

The additional configuration file [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]/etc/default/btsync[/b][/font] permits to specify some default startup parameters that may affect every configured instance of BitTorrent Sync.

The variable [b]AUTOSTART[/b] defines which instances are started automatically. It can take the following values:
[LIST]
[*][font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]none[/b][/font] No instance is started automatically[/*]
[*][font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]all[/b][/font] (default) All instances are started automatically[/*]
[*][font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]<list>[/b][/font] Only the specified instances are started automatically[/*]
[/LIST]
Instances not started automatically upon system startup can be managed manually from the command line:
[code]
# start a specific instance
service btsync start <instance_name>
# stop a specific instance
service btsync stop <instance_name>
[/code]
The advanced variable[b] DAEMON_ARGS[/b] allows to specify additional command line parameters passed to the daemon. [color=#b22222][b]WARNING[/b][/color]: Be careful! You should only add things here if you know [b]EXACTLY[/b] what you are doing!

The variable[b] DAEMON_BIND[/b] has the same purpose as the same parameter in the instance configuration files, but in this scope it will be applied by default to all instances. Please see the specific section below covering the specific interface binding topic.

The variable [b]DAEMON_INIT_DEBUG[/b] permits to enable extended debug output of the init-script.


[color=#000080][b]HANDLING OF SSL CERTIFICATES[/b][/color]

BitTorrent Sync 1.4 supports also SSL connections to the Web UI. The default instance is automatically configured to use a self signed certificate and key created during the installation.

The configuration file does not point directly to the self signed certificate but to the following symbolic links:
[code]
/etc/btsync/debconf-default.crt
/etc/btsync/debconf-default.key
[/code]

The default instance can be operated also with user provided certificates without tampering with the configuration file by deleting the symbolic links and replacing them with files containing the desired certificate and key. Debconf will detect that the files are not symbolic links and leave them untouched during reconfiguration.

The certificate file and key file must be accessible by the BitTorrent Sync daemon.


[color=#000080][b]BINDING BITTORRENT SYNC TO A SPECIFIC INTERFACE[/b][/color]

Unfortunately BitTorrent Sync currently does not support to bind the main service routine to a specific network interface. Currently only the internal web server providing the Web UI and the BitTorrent Sync API can be specifically bound to a specific address.

In order to limit the operation of BitTorrent Sync to a specific interface in a multihomed environment, a so called [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)]preload shim[/url]) can be used. The BitTorrent Sync repository contains a precompiled version of[url=http://www.ryde.net/code/] Daniel Ryde's bind.so shim[/url] that must be installed with:
[code=auto:0]`which sudo` apt-get install bind-shim[/code]
The BitTorrent Sync init script does detect the presence of the library and enables support for the additional parameter[b] DAEMON_BIND[/b] that can be specified either in[font=courier new,courier,monospace][b] /etc/default/btsync[/b][/font] or in instance configuration files.

By specifying a valid TCP/IP address assigned to one of the interfaces of the system, the BitTorrent Sync instance will bind only to that specific address. This will affect also the Web UI, if [font=courier new,courier,monospace][b]0.0.0.0[/b][/font] is specified as the bind address.


[color=#ff8c00][b]COMPATIBILITY[/b][/color]

The server packages are available for the same architectures as released by BitTorrent Inc.:

[LIST]
[*][b]i386[/b] Intel/AMD 32 Bit[/*]
[*][b]amd64[/b] Intel/AMD 64 Bit[/*]
[*][b]armel[/b] ARM EABI[/*]
[*][b]armhf[/b] ARM hard float[/*]
